# Reactulator

Reactulator is a quick project I set myself to complete in a day. The idea was to create a calculator app that would allow the user to do basic calculations.

**Features:**

The calculator ignores 0's or mathmatical opperators as a first input.

It has a delete button to delete the last input and a clear button to clear the entire calculation.

Once the user presses equals the calculator screen will clear the old calculation on the next button press.

The app was inspired by a sprint on the **Northcoders Bootcamp** and more specifically by the following article by Andrew Farmer:

## To run the app:

1. fork the repo.

2. using your terminal navigate to the file you wish to clone it in and type:

`git clone <your_url>`

3. run the following commands

`npm i`
`npm start`

you should now have the app up and running.
